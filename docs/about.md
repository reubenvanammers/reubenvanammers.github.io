I completed a Bachelor of Mathematical Physics and a Masters of Mathematics at the University of Melbourne. I completed my Masters thesis under Dr James Osborne, researching cellular remodelling. Following this, I entered the data space in a few companies around the Melbourne area, and am currently at Eliiza, an AI consultancy.

Generally interested in problems, especially at the intersection of mathematics and programming.
